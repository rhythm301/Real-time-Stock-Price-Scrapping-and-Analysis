    "## Web Scraping for Stock Prices in Python\n",
    "*This project demonstrates web scraping to extract current stock prices from websites using Python. By leveraging the **Requests**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Pandas** libraries, it fetches stock data from a given URL, processes the relevant information, and stores it in a structured Pandas DataFrame. Finally, the extracted data is saved in a CSV file for further analysis or use. This method is useful for collecting real-time stock market information for personal use or data analysis purposes.*"
